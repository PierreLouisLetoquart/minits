# Algorithms and Data Structures in TypeScript

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

```bash
bun install
```

## ðŸ§ª Running Tests

```bash
bun test
```

## ðŸ“š Context

This repository contains TypeScript implementations of various algorithms and data structures.
It was created as part of a personal training session and **is not intended for production use**.

The focus is on learning and deepening understanding of:

- TypeScript (with attention to typing, tooling, modularity)
- Classical algorithms and data structures
- Test-driven development using [Bun](https://bun.sh/)

Each implementation is fully tested using Bunâ€™s built-in test runner.
You can find the test cases in the `tests/` directory.
